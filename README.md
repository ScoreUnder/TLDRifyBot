# TLDRifyBot
A reddit bot for automatically providing a TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) summary for reddit link posts and text posts. With plans for comments and requested summary making. Uses PyTeaser and PRAW

PyTeaser:
  https://github.com/xiaoxu193/PyTeaser
  
Python Reddit API Wrapper:
  https://github.com/praw-dev/praw
  
  
Still a work in progress, uses a config file called 'account.cfg' for the account information in the same directory as the running application

Currently limited to play around in http://www.reddit.com/r/testingground4bots/
